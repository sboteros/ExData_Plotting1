# Dataset

This dataset is based on the "Individual housol electric power consumption
data set", taken from the
(UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository)[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/], which
contains measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a
one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years.

The variables in the dataset are explained in the (codebook)[CodeBook.md].

# Software

This code uses (`R`)[https://www.r-project.org/] with the libraries
(`dplyr`)[https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/] and
(`lubridate`)[https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/].

# Contents

This repo generates 4 graphs using the R base plotting system using the
(dataset)[#Dataset] for the period between February 1st and February 2nd of
2007. For each graph, there is an independent code that reads the data and saves
the graph in a bitmapped file. It generates the following plots:

+ `plot1.png` is a histogram of the variable `Global_active_power`, generated
by `plot1.R`.
+ `plot2.png` is a time-series plot of the variable `Global_active_power`,
generated  by `plot2.R`.
+ `plot3.png` is a time-series plot of the variables `Sub_metering_1`,
`Sub_metering_2` and `Sub_metering_3`, generated  by `plot3.R`.
+ `plot4.png`, generated by `plot4.R`, is a plot with 4 panels:
  - Topleft panel: Plot contained in `plot2.png`.
  - Bottomleft panel: Plot contained in `plot3.png`.
  - Topright panel: Is a time-series plot of the variable `voltage`.
  - Bottomright panel: Is a time-series plot of the variable
  `Global_reactive_power`.
